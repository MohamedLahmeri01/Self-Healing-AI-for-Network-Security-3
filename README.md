# Self-Healing-AI-for-Network-Security-3
Self-healing AI for network security leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to autonomously detect, diagnose, and mitigate cybersecurity threats in real-time. This approach enhances network resilience by automating responses to security incidents, reducing the need for manual intervention, and improving overall security.
